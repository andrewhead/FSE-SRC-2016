Results and contribution.
I want to touch upon each of the following.

What questions are participants least confident answering?

What are the most authoratative sources for answering each question?

How much do participants' perceptions of documentation change?  And how much do their opinions change?

And what does this all suggest for what's broken for information presentation, and the design of programmers' front-end to the web?
