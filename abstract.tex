% We describe a research agenda for collecting and exposing information about community, documentation, and developers.
Developers choose open source packages from many alternatives.
One increasingly important factor when choosing packages are their ``social health'', or developers' ability to get help on communication channels.
We conduct a study to understand how developers learn about the social health of open source packages before using them.
We offer preliminary results of the cues developers find.

Programmers reuse software all the time.
So much knowledge has migrated online, in the form of tutorials, questions and answers, and issues, authored by many and over the course of long times.
We run a study to characterize the extent to which information about programming packages is fragmented online.
We specifically focus on the problem of developers trying to learn about the health of the community and documentation for packages before using them.
We report several interesting findings.
For instance, \textbf{finding 1}.
Also, \textbf{finding 2}.
