In this abstract, we present a vision of socially-enabled software telemetry tools to help developers and maintainers make sense of the social strengths and hazards of software projects.
We describe a research agenda for collecting and exposing information about community, documentation, and developers.
We provide preliminary results from a study with developers, where we offer insights into what signals answer important social questions about software projects, and where these signals can be found on the web.

Programmers reuse software all the time.
So much knowledge has migrated online, in the form of tutorials, questions and answers, and issues, authored by many and over the course of long times.
We run a study to characterize the extent to which information about programming packages is fragmented online.
We specifically focus on the problem of developers trying to learn about the health of the community and documentation for packages before using them.
We report several interesting findings.
For instance, \textbf{finding 1}.
Also, \textbf{finding 2}.
