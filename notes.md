## New Content

* Actionable insights

We believe these obstacles are a product of developers' habits and the limitations of current information interfaces.
With attention to both, we can design more powerful search tools to help developers quickly and effectively learn about packages' social health when choosing between them.
In the meantime, our preliminary results suggest package consumers shouldn't trust initial instincts, but should inspect documents from explicit comparisons to forum discussions and issue reports to get a full picture of a package's social health.
Package developers should be aware that the footprint of the social health of their package is distributed across Reddit, Stack Overflow, GitHub, Google Groups, profiles of developers and beyond.
Potential users need help finding your community.
<!--* don't be afraid to dig into actual text of conversations-->

Developer-related issues:
* system image is across Reddit, Stack Overflow, GitHub, Google Groups, profiles of developers and beyond
* people need help finding your community

    * What to do as an API consumer?
        * Challenge yourself to look beyond documentation
        * A lack of links doesn't imply absence of material
    * What gives a developer an advantage?
        * Documentation appears to be a good place to start...
        * Decisions are made quickly about support

* Add a reference to Linares-Vasquez
    * Shows a different lens beyond: support happens
        * Support happens for a *reason*
        * The reason in this case is that breaking changes have happened in the API
        * Suggest that people use these channels to keep up to speed with quickly changing software

This has benefits, enabling them to leverage social media and other channels to stay informed and connect with other developers.
Today there is a proliferation of socially-enabled channels through which developers answer each others' questions,
help each other overcome bugs and learn new tools,
stay up-to-speed with rapidly changing software (Linares-Vasquez),
and share information in many different forms at many different speeds.
The knowledge and conversations of programmers are increasingly distributed across the web.

<!--* There's some evidence that API changes trigger Stack Overflow questions-->
* Describe the number of participants
We invited developers to a study where they compared the social health of two packages ->
We invited 10 developers to a study where they compared the social health of two packages.

* How many pairs of packages?
We invited developers to a study where they compared the social health of two packages.
Each participant chose one of three pairs of packages.
Each pair was for a different programming task.

* Hypotheses or research questions
Though we only report preliminary results, our research was motivated by these two research questions:
(1) What are the factors that make a participant prefer one package's documentation or questions over another?
(2) Which sites are the most used for which concerns?

# Questions

* Does the 2 pages include references?
