In this extended abstract, we propose that new tools can help developers make sense of a sprawl of social information for packages they choose.
By presenting preliminary results from a study with developers, we show evidence of what social signals exist on the web and where.
Our results will inform the design of search tools to help developers understand packages and their social health.
