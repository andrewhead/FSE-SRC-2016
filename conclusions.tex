In this extended abstract, we propose that new views are needed to help developers make sense of a sprawl of social information for the projects the evaluate, use, and maintain.
By presenting preliminary results from a study with developers, we show evidence of what social signals exist on the web and where.
This sets a research agenda for the design of socially-enabled software telemetry interfaces.
